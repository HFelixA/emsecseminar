\chapter{Masking the Ring-LWE Encryption Scheme I}
Since most side-channel attacks focus on the decryption operation, this section will present an attempt to masking the decryption function of the \textit{LPR} Ring-LWE encryption scheme. This masking approach was originally proposed in \cite{maskedRing}, for more details we would refer you to that paper.

\section{Implementation}
In this Section we will start by giving the reader an overview of the general setup, before going into more detail about the masked decoding algorithms.
